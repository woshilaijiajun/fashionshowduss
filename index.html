    <h1>Fashion Show Discussion</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>With the trend of the times, more and more people are becoming interested in fashion shows, but many people are not interested in them. Below, I will share my opinion.</p>
        <p>First of all, I need to oppose the fashion show as harsh and society and the environment. Now, let me share my viewpoint.</p>
        <p>The first fashion show can impress you in front of everyone, make them remember you better, and highlight your personality. For example, nowadays many people like cosplay where men dress up as women, right? Wearing this outside may cause everyone to burst into laughter, but it can also quickly make the other person remember you. Don't ask me how I found out, just ask, I've tried.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is not the best way to make others remember you quickly, but I know it is the simplest way in my understanding to make others remember you.</p>
        <p>The second one is that many of us follow the trend of the times to fashion show and gain a lot of fans, which is indeed good, and many people get money because of it.</p>
        <p>Overall, the fashion show is quite good.</p>
